Welcome to LoLLMS WebUI (Lord of Large Language Models: One tool to rule them all), the hub for LLM (Large Language Model) models. This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface to access and utilize various LLM models for a wide range of tasks. Whether you need help with writing, coding, organizing data, generating images, generating music or seeking answers to your questions, LoLLMS WebUI has got you covered.

As an all-encompassing tool with access to over 300 AI expert conditionning across diverse domains and more than 500 fine tuned models over multiple domains, you now have an immediate resource for any problem. Whether your car needs repair or if you need coding assistance in Python, C++ or JavaScript; feeling down about life decisions that were made wrongly yet unable see how? Ask Lollms. Need guidance on what lies ahead healthwise based on current symptoms presented, our medical assistance AI can help you get a potential diagnosis and guide you to seek the right medical care. If stuck with legal matters such contract interpretation feel free reach out to Lawyer personality, to get some insight at hand -all without leaving comfort home.

Want some entertainment? Then engage Laughter Botand let yourself go enjoy hysterical laughs until tears roll from eyes while playing Dungeons&Dragonsor make up crazy stories together thanks to Creative Story Generator. Need illustration work done? No worries, Artbot got us covered there! And last but definitely not least LordOfMusic here for music generation according to individual specifications. So essentially say goodbye boring nights alone because everything possible can be achieved within one single platform called Lollms...

Thank you for all users who tested this tool and helped making it more user friendly.

## Installation
### Automatic installation (UI)
If you are using Windows, just visit the release page, download the windows installer and install it.

### Automatic installation (Console)
Download the installation script from scripts folder and run it.
The installation scripts are:
- `win_install.bat` for Windows.
- `linux_install.sh`for Linux.
- `mac_install.sh`for Mac.

### Manual install with Anaconda/Miniconda:
If you don't have anaconda or miniconda installed, please install it:
[Install miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html)
Make sure to add it to your path so that you can run it easily from a terminal.
If you don't have git installed, please install it:
[Install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
Make sure to add it to your path so that you can run it easily from a terminal.
- Run a terminal and create a new environment called `lollms` with python 3.10:
```bash
conda create --name lollms python=3.10
```
- Activate the environment
```bash
conda activate lollms
```
- Clone the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ParisNeo/lollms-webui.git
```
- enter the lollms-webui folder
```bash
cd lollms-webui
```
- install dependancies
```bash
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```
- run the application
```bash
python app.py
```
### Manual install with virtual env:
Make sure you install python 3.10, and git:
[Install python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31013/)
Make sure to add it to your path so that you can run it easily from a terminal.
If you don't have git installed, please install it:
[Install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
Make sure to add it to your path so that you can run it easily from a terminal.
- Run a terminal and install pip:
```bash
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
```
- Install virtual environment:
```bash
pip install venv
```
- Clone the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ParisNeo/lollms-webui.git
```
- enter the lollms-webui folder
```bash
cd lollms-webui
```
- Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv ./env
```
- Activate the virtual environment:
- On windows: `./env/Scripts/activate`
- On linux: `./env/bin/activate`
- On macos: `./env/bin/activate`
- install dependancies
```bash
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```
- run the application
```bash
python app.py
```

Once installed, you need to activate the environment then run the app.

## Docker runtime
Docker is a software development runtime that lets you run code in isolated units called containers. You do not need to do any local installs above if you are using docker. (**NOTE: lollms' docker is in beta**)

Docker is available on Linux, MacOS, and Windows. You can install Docker on Linux. Docker supports CPU and Nvidia, but AMD does not support Docker.

Note: Eventually we may build and push public images, but until then we will keep the build process fast and easy so you can build your own container with one command.

### Using Docker
Set GPU to `cpu` or `nvidia`, depending on your gear.

Linux and MacOS
```bash
export GPU=cpu
docker-compose -f docker/$GPU/docker-compose.yml build
docker-compose -f docker/$GPU/docker-compose.yml up
```

Windows (cmd not powershell)
```cmd
set GPU=cpu
docker-compose -f docker/%GPU%/docker-compose.yml build
docker-compose -f docker/%GPU%/docker-compose.yml up
```

### Install Docker and docker-compose
Linux:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io
sudo systemctl enable --now docker

sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

MacOS and Windows: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

# Disclaimer
Large Language Models are amazing tools that can be used for diverse purposes. Lollms was built to harness this power to help the user inhance its productivity. But you need to keep in mind that these models have their limitations and should not replace human intelligence or creativity, but rather augment it by providing suggestions based on patterns found within large amounts of data. It is up to each individual how they choose use them responsibly!

The performance of the system varies depending on the used model, its size and the dataset on whichit has been trained. The larger a language model's training set (the more examples), generally speaking - better results will follow when using such systems as opposed those with smaller ones. But there is still no garantee that the output generated from any given prompt would always be perfect and it may contain errors due various reasons. So please make sure you do not use it for serious matters like choosing medications or making financial decisions without consultating an expert first hand !
